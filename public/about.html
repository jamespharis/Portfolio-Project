            Hello, my name is James Pharis.
            I’m from southeast Georgia, I recently graduated from Georgia Southern in 2023 with a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering. 
            I grew up surrounded by computers, with my dad being a programmer and my mom being an accountant. 
            So I have a natural attraction to spreadsheets and programming.

            To add to my development, I earned a summer job during high school with the IT director of my school. 
            My work primarily consisted of upgrading the hardware and software of computers around the school. 
            In order to improve the overall efficiency of computers on campus, I completed tasks such as replacing disk drives, and updating applications and the software of each computer. 
            I had additional duties as well, such as installing up cameras in various halls. After running the camera cables through walls and ceilings and dodging insulation, 
            I came to the realization that I would much rather advance into software development than networking and hardware.

            While earning my degree, I spent some time working part time jobs such as delivering pizzas for domino’s and as a retail associate at Cracker Barrel. 
            Because of that, I have a lot of experience working with and interacting with new people. 
            I love spending time with people, in fact, I want to be friends with everyone I meet, even if I can be a bit awkward at times. 
            Despite being introverted at times, being straightforward and honest with people comes easy to me, which allows me to push past awkward siutations. 
            This helps me connect with people fairly quickly and make deep and long-lasting friendships because I enjoy helping the people I care about. 
            This is especially beneficial in team environments, because becoming friends with your team can decrease overall stress and increase overall collaboration.

            In my free time, I love to play volleyball, tennis, and soccer. I also love to play video games, watch my favorite shows, and read manga or comics. 
            Lastly, one of my favorite things to do is to create spreadsheets on Google Sheets or Excel to keep track of my goals on various video games that I play. 
            An example would be tracking my progress towards achievements, or making a wish list of the in-game cosmetics that I would eventually like to earn. 
            These spreadsheets can have a wide variety of info stored in them, with some pages dedicated solely to tips & tricks about the game. 
            My particular attention to detail and love for being thorough can clearly be seen here.
            I have made these kinds of spreadsheets since middle school, but since learning to code, I’ve been able to make them much more efficient and organized without as much manual effort. 
        </p>

            My desire to help people creates a symbiotic relationship between my spreadsheets and my programming.  
            My methods facilitate growth and development because these two activities influence each other. 
            My passion for organization is a good example of this. 
            I want people to look at my spreadsheets and understand what is happening immediately; this leads me to write many comments in my code so that users can clearly comprehend my process. 
            I want to make sure each individual has a chance to fully grasp the process or concepts that are being shown to them so they can succeed in the future.
